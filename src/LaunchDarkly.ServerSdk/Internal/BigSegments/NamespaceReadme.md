This is an *internal* namespace for SDK implementation types related to the SDK's big segment
functionality.

It does not include implementations of specific big segment store integrations such as Redis.
Those are implemented in separate repositories such as https://github.com/launchdarkly/dotnet-server-sdk-redis.

These types should not be public and should not appear in documentation.
