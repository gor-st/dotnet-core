Interfaces that provide advanced SDK features or allow customization of LaunchDarkly components.

Most applications will not need to refer to these types. You will use them if you are creating a plug-in component, such as a database integration, or if you use advanced features such as <xref:LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.LdClient.DataStoreStatusProvider> or <xref:LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.LdClient.FlagTracker>.

The namespace also includes concrete types that are used as parameters within these interfaces.
